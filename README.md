# Image Classification using Machine learning models, KNN from scratch, LR, SVM models using CIFAR-10 dataset. 

## Descriptin
This project uses machine laerning models to classify images using CIFAR-10 dataset which contain about 60.000 images 
and viualize five samples for each class , then applying KNN model from scrach , SVM model , Logistic regression for Image Classification.
